# TIC-TAC-TOE GAME
I developed this game using HTML, CSS &amp; JAVASCRIPT. You can access this game at https://tictactoe-asmakhanam.netlify.app

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HOW TO PLAY:
To play the game, simply open the index.html file in your browser. The game will load and you will see a 3x3 grid with empty squares. Players take turns selecting a square to place their X or O mark. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

FEATURES:
The game board is responsive and adjusts to fit the screen size.
The game keeps track of the current player and displays their turn.
The game announces the winner or a tie at the end of the game.
The game stops after a winner is declared. 
Players can restart the game by clicking the "New Game" button.
